# Weather Dial - Flutter Clock Competition

Weather Dial has been developed to infuse time and weather, a window to the world from the comfort of the user's home.

This is achieved through the use of dynamic animated backgrounds, illustrating changes in the weather over day and night.

The hand design, colour and other subtle accents draw inspiration from the work of Dieter Rams, German Designer, at Braun.
